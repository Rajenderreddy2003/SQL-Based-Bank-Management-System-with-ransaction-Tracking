# Bank Account & Transaction Management System (SQL Project)

This project is a relational database system designed to manage banking operations such as customer details, account handling, transactions, and branch assignments.

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a normalized and secure SQL-based system to manage core banking functions.
- Ensure data integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys.
- Simulate real-world banking operations using sample data and queries.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- **Tables**: Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Branches, AccountBranch, LoginCredentials.
- **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness constraints.
- **DML Operations**: Inserted 20+ records in each table to simulate real banking data.
- **Complex Queries**:
  - JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
  - Subqueries (nested, correlated)
  - Views for public and internal reporting
  - Aggregations (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - String & Date functions
  - CASE statements for dynamic logic
- **ER Diagram**: Designed to reflect 1:1, 1:N, and M:N relationships.

## 🧪 Sample Use Cases

- View transaction summaries by type
- Track balances across account types
- Identify high-value customers
- Generate branch-wise reports
- Perform secure login simulation using hashed passwords

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **MySQL / SQL**
- ER Modeling

## 📁 Files Included

- `Project- Bank Account & Transaction System.sql`: Full DDL, DML, and query operations.
